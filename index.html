        <h2>Intro</h2>
        <p>The concept of evolution is very well known and almost completely agreed upon in the world.</p>
        <p>This theory states : Evolution is the change in heritable characteristics of biological populations over</p><p> multiple successive generations.</p>
        <p>There is a lot of evidence to support this theory.</p>
        <p>This website will be exploring that evidence in trying to prove the theory.</p>
        <p>There are multiple takes on this theory, the most popular being <a href="http://www.darwins-theory-of-evolution.com/">Charles Darwins theory.</a></p>
        <p>There is a lot of evidence to support this theory and just some examples will be explored in this website.</p>

        <h3>Fossils and Vestigial structures</h3>

        <img src="FossilIllu.jpg" title="Illustration of fossil records used as evidence for evolution." height="200"width="auto">

        <p>The <a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/fossil-record">fossil records</a> collected over time can show us a representation of the past.</p>
        <p>These fossil records when compared to todays organisms can show us the evolutionary change that took place.</p>
        <p>This clearly shows how life has changed over time.</p>
        <pre>

        </pre>
        <p>There is a lot of examples of this and only one will be explored in this section.</p>
        <h4>-Examples-</h4>
        <img src="WhaleEvo 2.png">
        <p>The image above shows us the supposed evolution of modern whales.</p>
        <p>We can clearly see the similarities between the fossils.</p>
        <p>The biggest piece of evidence is the pelvis that remained since the first ancestor but changed a lot.</p>
        <img src="Whale-Pelvis 2.png" height="150" width="auto">
        <p>This is named a "Vestigial structure" a structure that does not serve a purpose.</p>

      <div class="BioGeography">
        <h3>Biogeography</h3>
        <img src="BioG.jpg" width="200" height="auto">
        <p>BioGeography is the study of the distribution of organisms over geographical areas or regions.</p>
        <p>BioGeography is an important factor when it comes to researching evolution because geographical boundaries such as rivers,mountains and valleys,</p>
        <p>allow scientists to observe how a species evolves differently when seperated.</p>
        <pre>


        </pre>
        <p>There are a lot of examples on how biogegraphy supports the theory of evolution, only one is going to be explored in the next section.</p>
        <h4>-Examples-</h4>
        <img src="download 2.jpeg">
        <p>One of the biggest pieces of evidence for evolution comes from BioGeography,</p><p> this is because many of the important discoveries linked to evolution</p>
        <p>were made on remote islands. In the example of Charles Darwin,</p><p> many of his most important discoveries were made on the islands of Galapagos.</p>
        <p>Darwin noticed that a lot of the animals found on the islands were not found anywhere else in similar climate conditions on earth,</p><p> but were similar in the way they adapted.</p>
        <p>And to the question "Why do animals on distant and isolated landmasses appear related, but distinct?" his awnser was Evolution.</p>

      <div class="Embryos">
        <h3>Embryos</h3>
        <img src="Emb.jpeg" height="250">
        <p>An 'Embryo' is : an organism in its earliest stage of development.</p>
        <p>The way that embryos are can be used as evidence to support evolution is because of the following:</p>
        <p>Every type of organism has an embryo stage, this includes humans,fish and reptiles just as a few examples.</p>
        <p>But even though there is such a big difference in these organisms, they still have striking similarities in their embryo phase.</p>
        <p>The similarities are quite obvious but there are some examples that support the theory of evolution even more.</p>
        <pre>


        </pre>
        <h3>-Examples-</h3>
        <img src="Embr.jpg">
        <pre>


        </pre>
        <p>The image above shows the similarities between embryos but the biggest piece of evidence comes in the image below.</p>
        <img src="Fish.jpg">
        <p>This image shows that in the embryonic stage very different species including humans, all develop gill slits.</p>
        <p>In fish those slits develop into gills, while in humans they dissapear before birth.</p>
        <p>This shows us how similar the development of organisms is, pointing at a common ancestor, and thus pointing at evolution.</p>
